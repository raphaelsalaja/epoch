# The Problem

Fitness has always felt like more than sets, reps, and rest timers to me. It's the story of who I'm becoming. Progress doesn't just appear, it comes from deliberate practice, repeated over time. I've always wanted a way to see that bigger picture, not just log another workout.

> We are what we repeatedly do.<br/>
> Excellence, then, is not an act, <strong>but a habit.</strong> <br/>
> — Aristotle

The problem is, the fitness industry doesn't make that easy. I get tired of hidden sponsorships, manipulative tactics, and biased advice that erode trust.

Technology should help, but most apps I've tried only make training more cumbersome. They want me to buy gadgets, pay for bloated subscriptions, or wrestle with clunky features. I still see people using pen and paper or spreadsheets, and honestly, I've been there too. When I wanted something personal, it always felt like the only option was to pay a coach to build it for me while I live my life.

That frustration is why I started building Epoch.

# Why Epoch?

Epoch is my attempt to build the tool I wish I had. Something clear and intentional, structure without the jargon, tools without the friction, and knowledge without the bias.

> You do not rise to the level of your goals.<br/>
> You fall to the level of your systems.<br/>
> — James Clear

I want training to feel like a long integrated arc, not just a scattered logbook. With Epoch, you'll be able to build plans around natural cycles, set milestones, and actually see progress unfold over time. And you can do it with what you already own, no extra gear required.

# FAQ

## How is it different from other apps?

Epoch isn't a workout logger. It's a system for long-term training, rooted in periodization, the same principles used by athletes to sustain progress over months and years.

## Who is it for?

I'm building Epoch for anyone who wants training to feel intentional and sustainable, whether you're just starting out, deep into it, or coaching others.

## When will it launch?

Epoch is still in development. Join the waitlist and I'll share early access and updates as I go.
